        Thanks for taking the time to assign this coursework! 

        To support our trainees with planning and prioritising their own learning journey, we want our coursework assignments to be more informative. 
        We don't just want to tell them what to do, we want to tell them stuff like:
        - why we are doing it
        - what it's "for" (problem-solving, debugging, etc)
        - how long they should spend on it, maximum
        - how to get help 
        - how to review it with answers 
        - how to get it reviewed from mentors and peers

        **Thank you so much.**

        Please now complete this ticket by filling in the options on the sidebar.

        1. Update labels
        - priority -- is this coursework key, mandatory, or stretch? Pick one.
        - size -- help trainees plan their time with rough estimation. Pick one
        - topics -- add all that seem relevant to you. 
        2. Add to milestone
        - week 1,2,3,4

        Once your ticket is complete, you may like to add it to the example project board attached to this repo.
        This is so you understand how trainees will use your work. Nobody has built a board copier yet, so trainees will be doing this step themselves.
